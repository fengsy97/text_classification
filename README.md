# text_classification  
调参：
Train with or without dropout. (The dropout rate should be set to 0.2)
Train with different hidden size. (The hidden size should be set to 256
and 512)
Train with a different number of the hidden layer. (The number of hidden
layer should be set to 1 and 3)

Train with pre-trained word embedding. (We supply GloVe pretrained
word embedding with 300-dimension for your experiments and you can
explore the model performance with the same dimension without pretrained word embeddings.)

  
需要比较上述参数设置不同的精确度差异  
可以考虑如何利用短语和单词的情感标签来改进模型
